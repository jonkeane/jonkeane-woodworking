title: Streamdock
description: A custom stream deck holder and mic stand in walnut — I had some walnut leftover from a few other projects, so decided to make an integrated stand for my stream deck and microphone. Box joints on 45º + 135º were simultaneously more complicated than I thought they would be, but in the end easy enough (after a new jig). Unseen is the vibration isolation mount inside the stand itself. And no, I don't podcast or otherwise do audio work, why do you ask?
