title: Concorde mount
description: An oak mount for a model Concorde â€” I've always been obsessed with the Concorde, so when lego released a model of it I had to get one. Building it was fun, but the included stand didn't really fit where I wanted to put it. So I made this oak mount that could house it on the wall, but still be able to remove it when I wanted.
